i have created .net core web app. 
i want to create complete LMS application using .net core , sql , mongo , postgres 
(use multiple db for diff module so that we achive 2 thing first is understand how to connect multiple db and second is which db is use for 
what kind of data source), redice for cache, authentication RBAC, react for front end, logging,nunit for test cases, github for code, azure for hosting.
 lets start step step by in visual studio. my plan is we will create diff project as per responsibility for example,
 model we can keep for models, data for db context files, class repository , core , business something like this pattarn. 
 i am not sure what design pattern we can call this may be repository pattern. as a good techical architect please give me
 proper plan for LMS backend architecture


LMS.Models → this is where your Analytics models
LMS.Data → this is where your DbContext (AnalyticsDbContext) and EF Core configuration should live. 
LMS.Business → your repositories/services (e.g., AnalyticsRepository, AnalyticsService)  
LMS.WebApi → your controllers (e.g., AnalyticsController) will call into the business layer.
LMS.Core - interfaces
LMS.Test
LMS.Cache
LMS.Deploy
LMS.Logging

# 🔹 UI Structure (React)

### **Admin**

* Manage Users/Roles (SQL)
* View Activity Logs (Mongo)
* Manage All Courses

### **Instructor**

* Upload Documents (with Versioning)
* Submit Grades + Feedback

### 🧑‍🎓 Student Dashboard

* Profile (SQL)

---

### 👨‍🏫 Instructor Dashboard

### 👨‍💼 Admin Dashboard

Great question 👍 Let’s think about the **Admin Dashboard** separately.

Unlike students (who see their own progress & courses), the **Admin** needs a **management overview**.

---

## 🔹 Possible Admin Dashboard Features

### 1. **Stats Cards (High-level overview)**

* Total Students 👩‍🎓
* Total Courses 📚
* Active Enrollments 🔄
* Completed Courses ✅

(We can fetch these with an `AdminDashboardSummary` API — if you don’t have one, we can combine existing APIs to calculate.)

---

### 2. **Quick Access Lists**

* **Recent Students Registered** → show top 5 newest users
* **Popular Courses** → courses with most enrollments
* **Pending Approvals** (if you have course approval / user approval in your LMS)

---

### 3. **Navigation Shortcuts**

Buttons/links to:

* Manage Courses
* Manage Students
* Reports

---

### 📌 Wireframe (Admin Dashboard)

```
Welcome, Admin 👋

[👩‍🎓 Students: 120] [📚 Courses: 15] [🔄 Active Enrollments: 80] [✅ Completed: 45]

So yes — unlike students, the **Admin dashboard** is more about **managing the whole system**, not just their own learning.

---

👉 Do you want me to first **finalize Student Dashboard completely** (stats + courses), and then move to **Admin Dashboard** design/code?
